# 1 Introduction

Collections are used to store and group some variable number of data items that have some shared significance to the problem being solved and need to be operated upon together in some controlled fashion.

This module introduces you to a variety of collections that are used in several, most common contexts. As well as the `IEnumerable`-Interface, which allows easy iteration over your collection using `foreach`.

# 2 Collections

## Reusable Collections

The goal of most software written is to provide reusable components, in order to prevent us from needing to reinvent the wheel. This was accomplished in .NET over the years in multiple fashion.

## Non-Generic Collections

Non Generic collections in .NET are old-fashioned collections that provide no Type-Safety. They are included in the `System.Collections`-Namespace.

Look at this example of an ArrayList:

```cs
using System.Collections;

ArrayList list = new ArrayList();
list.Add("Hello");
list.Add(true);
list.Add(-5);
```

You can see, that we can add all kinds of data into this Data Structure. This might not be a problem, if you don't want to limit the kind of information that is stored in this Collection.

But what if you store for example a bunch of numbers and now you want to read them from the Collection? Well, you'll have to cast them first.

```cs
int first = (int) list[0];
int second = (int) list[1];
```

Why is that?

```cs
// Extracted from System.Collections.ArrayList.cs
public virtual int Add(object? value);
// ...
public virtual object? this[int index];
```

It is because this collection only stores information by their base type `object`. Therefore, when accessing any information from the `ArrayList`, you can never be 100% sure, what Type it is and need to do Type-Checking and Type-Casting.

In Summary, Non-Generic Collections are reusable, general-purpose Data Structures provide no Type-Safety, but allow you to store a variable amount of Data.

## Generic Collections

Generic Collections have been added to .NET when Generic Classes were introduced. They are included in the `System.Collections.Generic`-Namespace.

Look at this example of a List:

```cs
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<string> names = new List<string>();
names.Add("Marc");
names.Add("Daniel");
names.Add("Ren√©");
```

You can see that now we had to specify a Generic Type Argument for the `List`. This Data Structure will now only allow objects of type `string` to be added to it. Trying to add any other Data Type will result in Compiler Errors.

This also makes accessing the Data very easy:

```cs
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
numbers.Add(2);
numbers.Add(-5);
int first = numbers[0];
int second = numbers[1];
```

No Casting necessary. How come?

```cs
// Extracted from System.Collections.Generic.List.cs
public void Add(T item);
// ...
public T this[int index];
```

In other words, Generic Collections are reusable, general-purpose Data Structures that allow you to store a variable amount of Data in a Type-Safe manner.

# 3 Iterator Pattern

The Iterator Pattern is a Design Patterns used in Programming to allow us to sequentially visit all items in any type of collection.

## Design Patterns

Design Patterns are known, battle-proven solutions to problems commonly encountered in programming. Usually, you can't solve those categories of problems once and for all because of little differences and nuances in the details of the problem, but the correct Design Pattern an give you a great set of instructions on how to approach and implement the problem for your use case.

We will learn a lot more Design Patterns at a later point :)

## The Problem

We will learn about many different kinds of Collections. They all store items in different ways. Many of which don't have a clear order or a clear beginning and an end.

But then, how can we define a standardized way for looking at all items in a collection?

## The Solution

```cs
public interface ICollection {
    // Returns a class used for iterating over all elements
    IIterator GetIterator();
}
```

```cs
public interface IIterator {
    // tells you, whether there is any more elements
    bool HasNext();
    // returns the next element
    object GetNext();
}
```

Now, this Interface can be used as follows:

```cs
ICollection anyCollection = CreateRandomCollection();
IIterator iterator = anyCollection.GetIterator();
while(iterator.HasNext()){
    Console.WriteLine($"Next Element: {iterator.GetNext()}");
}
```

## IEnumerable

The `IEnumerable`-Interface is defined twice. Once as `System.Collections.IEnumerable` and once as `System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T>`. I guess you know, why? Because the latter is Type-Safe and used for Generic Collections.

The Purpose is for a class to implement the Iterator-Pattern, which is a very popular Design Pattern. A Design Pattern is a Pattern that has been specified as a solution to a certain kind of problem. Usually, Design Patterns require you to implement them for your specific use-case, but the code-structure usually looks very similar to the original.

The Iterator-Pattern is a smart solution which allows you to easily iterate over a collection of variable elements.

To iterate means to go through it and look at all elements which are stored in the Collection.

You need to know, that not all collections have an Order to it. Which means, that not all Collections allow you to use the indexer like `collection[0]` and `collection[25]` to access the elements at a certain position in the collection.

Iterators solve the problem, because you get access to all elements without any guaranteed order.

The Interface is defined as such:

```cs
namespace System.Collections;

public interface IEnumerable
{
    // Returns an IEnumerator for this enumerable Object.  The enumerator provides
    // a simple way to access all the contents of a collection.
    IEnumerator GetEnumerator();
}
```

Alright. This does not look all too interesting. All the Magic happens in the `IEnumerator`-Interface, I suppose?

## IEnumerator

```cs
namespace System.Collections;

public interface IEnumerator
{
    // Advances the enumerator to the next element of the enumeration and
    // returns a boolean indicating whether an element is available. Upon
    // creation, an enumerator is conceptually positioned before the first
    // element of the enumeration, and the first call to MoveNext
    // brings the first element of the enumeration into view.
    //
    bool MoveNext();

    // Returns the current element of the enumeration. The returned value is
    // undefined before the first call to MoveNext and following a
    // call to MoveNext that returned false. Multiple calls to
    // GetCurrent with no intervening calls to MoveNext
    // will return the same object.
    //
    object? Current
    {
        get;
    }

    // Resets the enumerator to the beginning of the enumeration, starting over.
    // The preferred behavior for Reset is to return the exact same enumeration.
    // This means if you modify the underlying collection then call Reset, your
    // IEnumerator will be invalid, just as it would have been if you had called
    // MoveNext or Current.
    //
    void Reset();
}
```

Alright, the Interface looks straightforward enough, doesn't it?

`bool MoveNext()` moves the Iterator to the next Element in the Collection. In the beginning, it is placed BEFORE the First Element. Which means, that you need to move it first before trying to access any element. It returns `true`, if it successfully moved the Iterator. If it returns `false`, it means that you've reached over the end of the Collection.

`Current {get;}` gives you the current Element of the Collection. It points at different Elements after calling `MoveNext`.

`void Reset()` allows you to reset the Enumerator, in case you want to start over from the first element again. This is pretty uncommon.

## foreach

If you have done the previous Exercise, then you have actually implemented your own Implementation of `foreach`.

`foreach` is only syntactic sugar which makes Code especially readable, if you want to iterate over a collection. Instead of calling `GetEnumerator()`, `MoveNext()` and `Current`, you can simply write:

```cs
using System.Collections.Generic;

List<int> numbers = new List<int>();
numbers.Add(2);
numbers.Add(5);
foreach(int number in numbers){
    System.Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

Pretty neat, or? Now, you've come to understand that this keyword does not do any Magic, but just uses existing Program Code under the hood. And that you are able to provide `foreach`-Support for your class by implementing the `IEnumerable` or `IEnumerable<T>`-Interface.

## yield

### Introduction

Now, `yield` is one of the keywords that struck me as Black Magic when I saw it the first time. I think that it is best explained through a code sample:

```cs
using System.Collections;

static IEnumerable GetNumbersUntil(int number) {
    for(int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        yield return i;
    }
}

foreach(var number in GetNumbersUntil(5)) {
    System.Console.WriteLine(number);
}
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

So, what has happened here? Somehow, the method was able to return multiple numbers. Does it pause and then continue again, or does it return a Collection of all numbers? Let's find out:

### Step-By-Step

```cs
using System.Collections;
using System;

static IEnumerable GetNumbersUntil(int number) {
    Console.WriteLine("[GetNumbersUntil] Start");
    for(int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        Console.WriteLine($"[GetNumbersUntil] Before yield return {i}");
        yield return i;
        Console.WriteLine($"[GetNumbersUntil] After yield return {i}");
    }
    Console.WriteLine($"[GetNumbersUntil] Finish");
}

foreach(var number in GetNumbersUntil(2))
{
    Console.WriteLine($"[Main] Got Number: {number}");
}
```

Output:
```
[GetNumbersUntil] Start
[GetNumbersUntil] Before yield return 0
[Main] Got Number: 0
[GetNumbersUntil] After yield return 0
[GetNumbersUntil] Before yield return 1
[Main] Got Number: 1
[GetNumbersUntil] After yield return 1
[GetNumbersUntil] Finish
```

We can see, that the Method gets interrupted by the `yield` Statement, to return a value. And then can be returned to, when the `foreach` statement is triggered again.

We already know that `foreach` calls `GetEnumerator` first. This returns an Iterator-Object for this method.

Then, `foreach` calls `MoveNext()` in every iteration, which makes the Iterator execute code from the object until the next `yield return` statement, making the returned value available as `Current` and returning `true`, so the `foreach` continues.

If `MoveNext()` hits a `yield break` or the end of the method, then it returns `false` and the `foreach` Loop ends.

### Under the Hood

But how is it possible, that a Method gets interrupted? We can take a look at the [Compiled C# Code](https://sharplab.io/#v2:CYLg1APgAgDABFAjAOgMIHsA2mCmBjAFwEt0A7AZwG4BYAKCgCZE66kA2BRAZjgHEcCAOQCuAWwBGOAE7kAqqWKYAFEQVxSYyVICUcAN504RzgE4lAIgDa/IZulyFRTAF04AZQIBDKQXPaatMZwAGboUipqRHAAvHAwlHBRADzqdlIJRGBgugaBQcZIZgAkVjYiEvbyiq4AQjihUjiciAgA7PpEAL5+AfkFiC1Q7US9faZKJdYC5VoO1XAAgsEE0s1tHd3+hsad20aFE6XTaXNOrgBiqkTkABY9dLu0dA04nng3SgBu3qkVUomkPjHP6nZQMbTaOi5IIHSYAWU8qlcvHQBDgM2kIH0Gj+mwCnSAA).

Here, you'll see the following (simplified):

```cs
private sealed class GetNumbersUntil : IEnumerable<object>, IEnumerable, IEnumerator<object>, IDisposable, IEnumerator
{
    private int __state;

    private object __current;

    private int number;

    private int i;

    object IEnumerator<object>.Current
    {
        [DebuggerHidden]
        get
        {
            return __current;
        }
    }

    [DebuggerHidden]
    public GetNumbersUntil(int __state)
    {
        this.__state = __state;
    }

    private bool MoveNext()
    {
        int num = __state;
        if (num != 0)
        {
            if (num != 1)
            {
                return false;
            }
            __state = -1;
            Console.WriteLine(string.Format("[GetNumbersUntil] After yield return {0}", i));
            i++;
        }
        else
        {
            __state = -1;
            Console.WriteLine("[GetNumbersUntil] Start");
            i = 0;
        }
        if (i < number)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(string.Format("[GetNumbersUntil] Before yield return {0}", i));
            __current = i;
            __state = 1;
            return true;
        }
        Console.WriteLine("[GetNumbersUntil] Finish");
        return false;
    }

    [DebuggerHidden]
    IEnumerator<object> IEnumerable<object>.GetEnumerator()
    {
        if (thisStateMachineIsReset)
        {
            return this;
        }
        else
        {
            return new StateMachine();
        }
    }
}
```

Woah, that's not easy to read. But basically, our Method gets compiled into a `class` which is a State Machine (Note: We'll learn about State Machines later, in Design Pattern classes). That increases `__state` every time `MoveNext()` is called and thereby moves on to the next statement. Also, `GetEnumerator` returns the State Machine itself as an `Enumerable`, but only, if it's currently not in use. Else, it will return a new State Machine.

Again, not really Black Magic, our Computer does not need to learn to interrupt methods. Instead, the Compiler converts our simple-looking code into something quite complex to enable this to work.

### Why not simply return a List?

For the previous example, we also could've written the following code:

```cs
using System.Collections;

static IEnumerable GetNumbersUntil(int number) {
    int[] result = new int[number];
    for(int i = 0; i < number; i++) {
        result[i] = i;
    }
    return result;
}
```

But what's the disadvantage here?

You'll find out, if you try executing the following:

```cs
double total = 0;
foreach(int number in GetNumbersUntil(1000000000)){
    total += number;
}
Console.WriteLine($"Total: {total}");
```

Output:
```
Total: 4.99999999067109E+17
```

This should work just fine (though take a while), if you used `yield`, but probably it will take forever or crash, if you use the solution that returns an Array. 

### Question
Why?

### One at a time

Because `yield` allows you to use a technique called `Streaming`. Where instead of doing all work at once and returning a giant object containing the whole result, you do the work bit by bit and always return a small bit of the result. This makes apps more responsive and can reduce Memory Usage in this case from 4GB to to 4 bytes!

The same technique is used almost everywhere else in Programming. For example, when you stream a show on Netflix. Instead of downloading the whole 4GB Movie, it will stream it bit by bit. Allowing you to start watching after a few kiloBytes already.

In other words: Don't underestimate the power of `yield` and use it where ever it makes sense.

### Coroutines

Let's have a look at Unity's Coroutines again:

```cs
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

IEnumerator Despawn(){
    Debug.Log("Hello there!");
    yield return new WaitForSeconds(2);
    Debug.Log("Hello from the future!");
}
StartCoroutine(Despawn());
```

So, what Unity does also is not any sort of Black Magic. When you call `StartCoroutine` and pass it an `IEnumerator`, it will continue calling `MoveNext` until it returns false. If `Current` points to a `WaitForSeconds`-Object, then Unity will know to wait until the two seconds are over before calling `MoveNext` again. Brilliant :)

# 4 Linked List (Introduction)

## Problem
Arrays can not be resized. You can only create them with one size and that's it, they can not grow or shrink (There will be another, more efficient solution to this problem later). So Arrays won't work if we want to build a collection that can continuously grow as elements are added.

```cs

int[] numbers = new int[3];
int numberCount = 0;

void AddNumber(int number){
    numbers[numberCount++] = number;
}

int GetNumber(int index){
    return numbers[index];
}

AddNumber(1);
AddNumber(2);
AddNumber(3);
AddNumber(4); // EXCEPTION! Why?
GetNumber(0);
GetNumber(3); // EXCEPTION! Why?
```

### Incomplete Solution: Bigger Array

The solution to above problem could be to just create a bigger Array.

```cs
int[] numbers = new int[100];
```

But what, if we need more than 100 numbers?

### Incomplete Solution: Really Big Array

```cs
int[] numbers = new int[10_000_000];
```

- Still, it could happen that we need more than 100_000 Elements. You can't predict every edge case.
- Also, above array consumes a lot of Memory (40MB)
  - One `int` has 4 bytes
  - We got an array for `10_000_000` Elements
  - `10_000_000 * 4B = 40_000_000B`
    - `40_000_000B / 1024 = 39_062.5 KB`
    - `49_062.5KB / 1024 = 38.15MB`

## Solution
Instead of storing our Elements in an Array, we could create a Linked List.
- We store each Element in a `Node`
- Each `Node` remembers its `Next` or `Previous` Node.

Imagine a Queue in a shop. Instead of every customer receiving a numbered place in the queue (like an index in an array), you just tell every customer to remember who got the spot before them. If you now want to talk to every customer, you just start with the last one and then ask the customer, who had the spot before him. You repeat that process with each customer until one customer says. "That's it, I'm the last one!"

### Part 1: The Node
The Node can store one number as well as a reference to the previous Node:

```cs
public class Node {
    public int Value;
    public Node Previous;
}
```

### Part 2: A Demo for Adding and Printing Numbers

```cs
Node LastNode = null;
void AddNumber(int number){
    LastNode = new Node{
        Value = number,
        Previous = LastNode
    };
}
void PrintAllNumbers() {
    Node CurrentNode = LastNode;
    while(CurrentNode != null){
        Console.Write($"{CurrentNode.Value}, ");
    }
    Console.WriteLine("(END)");
}

for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++){
    AddNumber(i);
}

PrintAllNumbers();
```

#### Add Number Explained

Above implementation of `AddNumber` does a lot of things within a single Expression. Let's look at a version where each step is split up into its own expression:

```cs
void AddNumber(int number){
    // Create a new Node, so we can store the new number
    Node newNode = new Node();
    // Store the new number to the Node
    newNode.Value = number;
    // Have the Node remember the currently last node as its previous
    newNode.Previous = LastNode;
    // The new node is now the new last node
    LastNode = newNode;
}
```

#### Print Numbers Explained
```cs
void PrintAllNumbers() {
    // We begin by looking at the last Node
    Node CurrentNode = LastNode;
    // If it is not null (that means that there is no more Nodes), then:
    while(CurrentNode != null){
        // We print the value of the current Node
        Console.Write($"{CurrentNode.Value}, ");
        // And ask the node for its previous one, so we can continue with that one.
        CurrentNode = CurrentNode.Previous;
    } // The Loop will jump back here.

    // If the While Loop has ended that means that there is no more Nodes.
    Console.WriteLine("(END)");
}
```

Above kind of collection will the basis for the upcoming Collection Exercises, so make sure that you have understood it well.

# 5 Stack (Linked)

Let's implement our first own Collection! The Stack is used whenever you want to have a collection where the latest element is returned first. Imagine it like a Stack of Plates. You usually put Plates on the top of a stack and you also take plates from the top of the stack first.

## LIFO Principle
> Last in, first out.

This means that the items are returned in reverse order. The one that was added last is returned first and then the previous one etc. The item that was added first is returned last.

## Usage
If you have a bunch of work and need to:
- pause some work when other comes in.
- then continue when the new work is done.
- very often used in algorithms like Pathfinding, AI, ...
- also, every computer program (Call Stack)

If you have a game with a stack of things, where only the top one can be retrieved
- e.g. a deck of cards

Game States and UI States
- e.g. Main Menu (bottom) -> Settings -> Confirm Popup (top)

History
- e.g. Browser History, File Explorer History, Undo/Redo

## Specification

Class: `TurboStack<T>`

A Stack's common Interface contains the following:

```cs
// returns the current number of items contained in the stack.
int Count;
// adds one item on top of the stack.
void Push(T item);
// returns the item on top of the stack without removing it.
T Peek();
// returns the item on top of the stack and removes it at the same time.
T Pop();
// removes all items from the stack.
void Clear();
// --------------- BONUS ---------------
// gets the iterator for this collection. Used by IEnumerable<T>-Interface to support foreach.
IEnumerator<T> IEnumerable<T>.GetEnumerator();
```
### Application: GameStateHistory

Write a `GameStateHistory` - Console Application in which multiple states exist. 
- From Main Menu, you can go to Level 1, Settings or Quit.
- From Settings you can not go anywhere
- On Quit the Application Quits
- From Level 1, you can go to Level 2 or the Main Menu.
- From Level 2, you can go to Level 3 or the Main Menu
- etc.

On top of that, you have one more options at all times (unless it's not possible):
- Go Backward: Goes back to the previous State in the history

It should look something like this:

```
You are here: Main Menu
What do you want to do?
(0): Go to Level 1
(1): Go to Settings
<<< 0
You are here: Level 1
What do you want to do?
(0): Go to Level 2
(1): Go to Main Menu
(b): Go back to Main Menu
<<< 0
You are here: Level 2
What do you want to do?
(0): Go to Level 3
(1): Go to Main Menu
(b): Go back to Level 1
<<< b
You are here: Level 1
What do you want to do?
(0): Go to Level 2
(1): Go to Main Menu
(b): Go back to Main Menu
```

Use a Stack to keep track of the History.

- What if you also wanted to be able to go forward again?

---

# 6 Queue

This is the opposite of a Stack. A Queue follows the

## FIFO Principle
> First in, first out.

This means that the items are returned in the same order in which they were added to the queue. The item that was added first is returned first and then the next one etc. The item that was added last is returned last. Like any Queue online or in front of the liquor store on New Year's Eve.

## Usage
If you have more work coming in than you can handle and want to make sure that they all get handled in fair oder. First come, first serve.
- e.g. Players queueing for Matchmaking, festival ticket booking or a full Server.

Or you just want to do the work later for some reason.
- e.g. the Game is paused right now.

If you want things to happen sequenced one after another.
- e.g. download a file, then load the file as a scene, then start the game.

If you want to queue up Game Events or Player Input
- e.g. multiple pop-ups appearing on Game Star, or a player queueing actions in a strategy game. Walk, then Attack the Tower, then Kill the goddamn sheep.

## Specification

Class: `TurboQueue<T>`

A Queue's common Interface contains the following:

```cs
// returns the current amount of items contained in the stack.
int Count;
// adds one item to the back of the queue.
void Enqueue(T item);
// returns the item in the front of the queue without removing it.
T Peek();
// returns the item in the front of the queue and removes it at the same time.
T Dequeue();
// removes all items from the queue.
void Clear();
// --------------- optional ---------------
// gets the iterator for this collection. Used by IEnumerable<T>-Interface to support foreach.
IEnumerator<T> IEnumerable<T>.GetEnumerator();
```

## Implementation
- Reference First Node
- Each Node references Next Node
- New Nodes get added after last Node


# 7 Complexity
When handling collections, we often discuss an operation's complexity.
- We will learn the details in Part 2, Sorting.
- But in Short: The more elements in a collection we need to iterate over for a certain operation, the higher its complexity is.
  - O(1) means, that we can can always complete the operation without running over all nodes.
    - e.g. our `TurboLinkedQueue`'s `Dequeue` Function can directly dequeue the Node without running through all Nodes.
  - O(n) means, that we need to iterate over all nodes in order to complete an operation.
    - e.g. our `TurboLinkedQueue`'s `Count` Property needs to iterate over all nodes until it can say for sure, how many there are.
    - do you have an idea, how you could improve that?
    - implement it!

The solution to such problems is usually to cache some information. We often trade Complexity for Storage. In this case, the solutions are quite easy.

# 8 List

## Introduction

It will not require the `yield` Statement, no worries :)

Our class will be called `TurboList` and it will be a Generic Collection. Not that our implementation would be any better or faster than the original .NET implementation, but I want to avoid us having name conflicts with the existing `List<T>` all the time.

The Idea of a List is that it behaves very similar to an Array. But instead of giving a fixed size to the List, it should Resize itself automatically to our needs. In other words, we should be able to Add and Remove Items as we want. The Method `Add` just puts an item at the end of the List. Making it especially easy to add an item.

## Usage

Anything that you have a variable number of; e.g.:
- Items
- Players
- Enemies
- PowerUps
- Achievements
- Orders
- ...


## Specification

A List's common interface contains the following:

```cs
// returns the current amount of items contained in the list.
int Count;
// adds one item to the end of the list.
void Add(T item);
// gets the item at the specified index. If the index is outside the correct range, an exception is thrown.
T Get(int index);
// replaces the item at the specified index. If the index is outside the correct range, an exception is thrown.
void Set(int index, T value);
// removes all items from the list.
void Clear();
// removes one item from the list. If the 4th item is removed, then the 5th item becomes the 4th, the 6th becomes the 5th and so on.
void RemoveAt(int index);
// --------------- optional ---------------
// returns true, if the given item can be found in the list, else false.
bool Contains(T item);
// returns the index of the given item if it is in the list, else -1.
int IndexOf(T item);
// removes the first instance of the specified item from the list, if it can be found. Works similar to RemoveAt.
void Remove(T item);
// adds multiple items ad the end of this list at once. Works similar to Add.
void AddRange(IEnumerable<T> items);
// --------------- important, but difficult ---------------
// gets the iterator for this collection. Used by IEnumerable<T>-Interface to support foreach.
IEnumerator<T> IEnumerable<T>.GetEnumerator();
```

## Remarks

We have not discussed `Exceptions` in Detail, yet. But in its easiest way, you can throw an Exception like this:

```cs
throw new System.Exception("Describe your error well here, so the user understands why his application crashed.");
```

Your `TurboList` will need to be able to store a variable amount of data. It should do so by containing an Array as a field which sometimes will need to be resized. When resizing an Array, you need to create a new, larger Array that can fit all elements and then copy the elements from the old to the new Array.

```cs
private T[] items;
```

Hint: The Method `Array.Resize(ref Array array, int newSize)` exists. And yes, it would be the correct way to use it instead of manually resizing the Array. But that method needs to do exactly that, too (create a new array and copy all items) and I want to show you just how much work needs to be done when an Array is being resized. To make a point later on in this course :)

## Repository / Solution

For this implementation, we will set up a Solution which will allow you to work Test-Driven.

Here's a Guideline for how to use the DotNet CLI to do so: [CLI Multi-Project Setup](https://gist.github.com/InaSLew/a0b174f07fb657e8a3133daa3e942fb9)

## Application: CustomerManager

The Idea is to write an application that allows you to add and remove customers to a list.

```
Choose one option:
(1) Add a Customer
(2) Remove a Customer by name
(3) Remove a Customer by index
(4) Display all Customers
<<< 1
What is the Customer's name?
<<< Marc
Choose an option:
(1) Add a Customer
(2) Remove a Customer by name
(3) Remove a Customer by index
(4) Display all Customers
<<< 1
What is the Customer's name?
<<< Anna
Choose an option:
(1) Add a Customer
(2) Remove a Customer by name
(3) Remove a Customer by index
(4) Display all Customers
<<< 1
What is the Customer's name?
<<< Max
Choose an option:
(1) Add a Customer
(2) Remove a Customer by name
(3) Remove a Customer by index
(4) Display all Customers
<<< 4
0: Marc
1: Anna
2: Max
Choose an option:
(1) Add a Customer
(2) Remove a Customer by name
(3) Remove a Customer by index
(4) Display all Customers
<<< 2
What is the Customer's name?
<<< Marc
Choose an option:
(1) Add a Customer
(2) Remove a Customer by name
(3) Remove a Customer by index
(4) Display all Customers
<<< 4
0: Anna
1: Max
Choose an option:
(1) Add a Customer
(2) Remove a Customer by name
(3) Remove a Customer by index
(4) Display all Customers
<<< 3
What index?
<<< 1
Choose an option:
(1) Add a Customer
(2) Remove a Customer by name
(3) Remove a Customer by index
(4) Display all Customers
<<< 4
0: Anna
```

## You did it wrong!

Have you completed all of the steps for implementing the `TurboList`? Well, then chances are that you did it wrongly. Sorry. Well, not wrong really, but quite wasteful of resources.

Most probably, you resized the Array every time an element is added and probably also when it's removed? Like this:

| Action | List Count | Array Length | Garbage Created
:---------:|:------------:|:---------------:|:-------_:
|     |     0      |  0 | 0
| Add |     1      |  1 | 12
| Add |     2      |  2 | 16
| Add |     3      |  3 | 20
| Add |     4      |  4 | 24
| Remove |     3      |  3 | 28
| Add |     4      |  4 | 24
| Add |     5      |  5 | 28

What is the problem with this? Well, every time when the Array needs to be Resized, a new Array is created and the old one is dumped. This Creates Garbage.
- Garbage is the amount of bytes that need to be collected and freed by the Garbage Collector.
- Whenever a Heap Object is no longer referenced, the Garbage Collector needs to free its allocated memory address range, so it can be re-used for new objects.
- The Garbage collected includes:
  - 12 Bytes Overhead of the Array Class
  - 4 Bytes for each `int` Element

 That's a lot of wasted resources. Ideally, your list would do something like this:

| Action | List Count | Array Length | Garbage Created
:---------:|:------------:|:---------------:|:----------:
|     |     0      |  0 | 0
| Add |     1      |  4 | 12*
| Add |     2      |  4 | 0
| Add |     3      |  4 | 0
| Add |     4      |  4 | 0
| Remove |     3      |  4 | 0
| Add |     4      |  4 | 0
| Add |     5      |  8 | 28

*This Garbage could also be reduced to zero, if you use `Array.Empty<int>()` when initializing an empty array.
- The Method returns a shared static empty array.
- Instead of creating a new one.
- This is no problem, since an empty array can never change.

In other words: always make sure that there's some extra space in the buffer. It is quite common to always resize the array to double the size when needing to increase the size. And to never decrease it. This will reduce performance wasted on: Memory Allocation, Copying Memory and Garbage Collection. But it will instead waste resources on some unused Memory (if your list only needs 9 elements, then a buffer for 16 elements is quite wasteful).

This is very common with Algorithms and Data Structures: you either benefit in less Memory Consumption, or better CPU Performance.

# 9 LINQ

LINQ, or Language-Integrated-Query, is a technology by .NET which allows to handle Collections like Streams and manipulate them in a similar fashion to how you can manipulate Streams by nesting them. Imagine the following case:

```cs
Animal animals = zoo.GetAnimals();

class Cat : Animal {
    public string FavoriteFood;
    public FoodBowl FoodBowl;
}

class Animal {
    public bool IsHungry;
}

class FoodBowl{
    public void Fill(string food){}
}
```

Now, we notice that we have a lot of tuna left. We want to feed the cats, because they've not eaten in a while. But of course, we only want to feed the cats which are Hungry and like Tuna. Because cats are pretty picky, we have learned that the hard way. Also, they have their favorite FoodBowls. Cats are not easy to please.

We could implement it like this:

```cs
foreach(Animal animal in animals){
    if(animal.IsHungry){
        if(animal is Cat cat){
            if(cat.FavoriteFood == "Tuna"){
                cat.FoodBowl.Fill("Tuna");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This should work. But what if it's not our Job to actually fill the bowl? We have an assistant that we need to provide with the information, so we should give him a list of all FoodBowls to fill with Tuna:

```cs
List<FoodBowl> foodBowls = new List<FoodBowl>();
foreach(Animal animal in animals){
    if(animal.IsHungry){
        if(animal is Cat cat){
            if(cat.FavoriteFood == "Tuna"){
                foodBowls.Add(cat.FoodBowl);
            }
        }
    }
}
assistant.OrderToFill("Tuna", foodBowls);
```

Neat! But also quite complex. Also, if we have thousands of cats, this will be a very large array again. What if we could Stream the Data to our Assistant? Fact is, we can!

```cs
IEnumerable<FoodBowl> foodBowls = animals
    .Where(animal => animal.IsHungry)
    .OfType<Cat>()
    .Where(cat => cat.FavoriteFood == "Tuna")
    .Select(cat => cat.FoodBowl);

assistant.OrderToFill("Tuna", foodBowls);
```

Pretty cool and expressive, or? And you can do so many more complex things with LINQ: 
- `Concat`: Combine to Collections
- `GroupBy`: Group a Collection by some common Property
- `First`: Get the first item. Exception if none.
- `FirstOrDefault`: Get the first item. Default if none.
- `Single`: Get one element for a condition. Exception if not exactly one.
- `Any`: Returns true, if any item satisfies a condition.
- `OrderBy`: Sort in ascending order.
- `OrderByDescending`: Sort in descending order.
- `ToDictionary`, `ToArray`, `ToList`: Convert to Collection-Type
- ... and many more.

## Usage:
- AI: Find all buildings of the player. Filter them by only the ones the AI has discovered. Filter them by the ones that seem not too well defended. Sort them by Priority. Attack the First.
- Multiplayer: Show Clan-Members. Filter by the ones being online OR being a High Rank. Sort them by Rank.


# Queue

We have learned about Lists and Stacks, the third of the most important Collections is the Queue. It is used, when things should get in order to be dealt with one at a time. They follow the

## FIFO Principle
> First in, first out.

This means that the items are returned in correct order. The one that was added first is returned first and then the next one etc. The item that was added last is returned last. Like any Queue online or in front of the liquor store New Year's Eve.

## Usage
If you have more work coming in than you can handle and want to make sure that they all get handled in fair oder. First come, first serve.
- e.g. Players queueing for Matchmaking, festival ticket booking or a full Server.

Or you just want to do the work later for some reason.
- e.g. the Game is paused right now.

If you want things to happen sequenced one after another.
- e.g. download a file, then load the file as a scene, then start the game.

If you want to queue up Game Events or Player Input
- e.g. multiple pop-ups appearing on Game Star, or a player queueing actions in a strategy game. Walk, then Attack the Tower, then Kill the goddamn sheep.

## Specification

Class: `TurboQueue<T>`

A Queue's common Interface contains the following:

```cs
// returns the current amount of items contained in the stack.
int Count;
// adds one item to the back of the queue.
void Enqueue(T item);
// returns the item in the front of the queue without removing it.
T Peek();
// returns the item in the front of the queue and removes it at the same time.
T Dequeue();
// removes all items from the queue.
void Clear();
// --------------- optional ---------------
// gets the iterator for this collection. Used by IEnumerable<T>-Interface to support foreach.
IEnumerator<T> IEnumerable<T>.GetEnumerator();
```

Well, this one is a bit more trouble-some than the Stack, isn't it?

The first, most obvious implementation is quite understandable. I recommend you to go for that one.

But then, look at the Dequeue-Method. It's a lot of work, isn't it? It's a bit like with the List:
- removing something from the end is super easy.
- but removing something from the front or in between? That requires a lot of shifting.

Try to think of a method using one Array that only needs ot move items around if the Buffer needs to be resized.

How would you go at that?

# Further Research
- Read up on Linked Lists: Singly, Doubly, Circular
- Implement `TurboLinkedQueue` and `TurboLinkedStack` as Linked Lists.
- Can you think of other situations in which you could use the solution for the Queue-Spoiler?
- Try publish your TurboCollections on NuGet. The name `TurboCollections` is already taken, though :P
- Create a new Project outside of the solution. Add your NuGet-Package using `dotnet add package <packagename>`. Can you use your Library? How does updating the Library work?
